# MyFirstRepo
My 2 weeks Progress 

In these 2 weeks I have learnt basics of git means how to use it.
I have worked on my programming language i.e, JAVA.
I am currently studying Data Structure from geeks for geeks and Data Structure and Algorithm made Easy a book by narsimha karumanchi.
Also I have completed a small course of GIT on the platform called Progate.

So, in short I am just trying to polish my skills and trying to deal with different coding problems.
Also, I am looking forward to upload one of my work on GitHub which a small website related to a Travel Agency.
That's it from my side. Peace out.
